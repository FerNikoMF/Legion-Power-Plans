## Repository Contents

* **Modify/**
  This folder contains the modified power plans (.pow files) created to improve temperature and power management.

* **Stock Legion/**
  This folder contains the original (stock) power plans from Lenovo. It also includes a `Setup.cmd` file, which is an alternative installation method.

* **PowerPlanOptions.reg**
  This registry file is required to unlock some hidden options in Windows power plan settings. Importing it is mandatory for all plans to work correctly.

* **PowerPlan-Installer.bat**
  This is the main executable file. It provides a convenient menu that allows you to choose which set of power plans you want to install â€” either the modified or the stock ones. The script automatically imports both the power plans and the registry file.

## Recommended Tool

For more advanced control over your Lenovo Legion laptop, including power management, lighting, and other features, we highly recommend checking out the [Lenovo Legion Toolkit](https://github.com/BartoszCichecki/LenovoLegionToolkit) project. It serves as a powerful alternative to the standard Lenovo Vantage application.
